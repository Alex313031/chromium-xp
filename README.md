# Chromium XP

Based on M49.0.2623.112

Builds of Chromium for Windows XP, Server 2003, and Windows 2000 (With BlackWingCat's Extended Kernel Patch and latest MSU Update Rollup 4)

I will be attempting to fix some things, backport some stuff, and use compiler optimizations from [Thorium](https://thorium.rocks/), except no AVX (will be using SSE3 as the baseline).
